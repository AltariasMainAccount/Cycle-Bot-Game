# Repl.it Bot
Welcome to the repl.it bot! You are playing as a coder who makes programs in order to get cycles. You can extend your reach to youtube and twitch to become the most cycled!

You can invite the bot [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=781939317450342470&permissions=265280&scope=bot). Enjoy!


## How to play
The prefix is `&`. Use `&help` to see all commands.

## Building
The program will try to read the `.env` file use `dotenv`. Your `.env` file should look something like:
```sh
TOKEN=insert_token_here
```
Make sure not to commit `.env`!

Afterwards, make sure you have typescript installed. To compile your bot during development, run
```sh
npm run dev
```

Then do `node .` to run your bot.

## Contributions
Suggestions are very much welcome!
